For project 3 our team chose to follow a combination of an agile model and a prototyping model. 
Having had experience with both of these process models, we felt it was best to put them together to see how we could pick the best parts of each to increase our productivity and efficiency.
We started project 3 by following a tutorial to understand how our platform, Unity, worked and how we would be able to build from it. Our first sprint was to get the basic game built and to have the general gameplay down. This was mostly done, but overall this proved to be our first iteration.
Once this iteration was completed we worked together to determine what absolutely needed to be changed. We wanted the game to be harder, so we chose to change the infinite firing of the player’s weapon to only fire once per tap/click. After this was implemented we determined that the asteroid spawning was too uniform. We chose to change this so each asteroid’s velocity would increase as time went on. This iteration was met with a lot of pushback as the game became almost impossible. Immediately we changed this to increase with a fraction of time, but still the game was far too difficult. Ultimately we chose to implement the asteroids spawning with a random velocity from a specified range.
In total, I believe we had somewhere around 5 iterations. With each one of these we talked to each other, in meetings and outside of them to determine the most effective ways to implement solutions. We followed through with what we were having troubles with in meetings and also made it a goal have things done before specific days. 
Using a combination of agile and prototyping we were able to get a prototype for the game completed.
